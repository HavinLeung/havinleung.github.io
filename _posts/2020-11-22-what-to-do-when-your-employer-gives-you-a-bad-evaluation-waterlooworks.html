title: What to do when your employer gives you a bad evaluation (WaterlooWorks)
---
<p>For uWaterloo co-op students, at the end of your work term you get a work term evaluation. You get graded on certain characteristics, as well as receive a final overall evaluation with the following possible grades:</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&#91;UNSATISFACTORY, MARGINAL, SATISFACTORY, GOOD, VERY GOOD, EXCELLENT, OUTSTANDING]</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This seems like a decent scale, but a problem arises when your employer takes the scale literally and doesn't know about how inflated these evaluations typically are. The <em>vast majority</em> of students get a score of Excellent or Outstanding. Anything below that could be considered a red flag!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here's how you showcase proof of rating inflation and help argue for a better evaluation:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Show your supervisor <a href="https://krishn.me/syde-2018-profile.pdf">this pdf</a> (the SYDE 2018 class profile), page 14
<ul>
<li><em>"91% of students were consistently rated as Outstanding or Excellent, suggesting rating inflation"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Show your supervisor <a href="http://joeyloi.com/SYDE2017classprofile.pdf">this pdf</a> (the SYDE 2017 class profile), page 17
<ul>
<li>Shows the same thing as above but in a different graduating class, and with a nicer chart to illustrate this claim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's also the SYDE 2019 class profile <a href="https://ndey96.github.io/syde_2019_class_profile.pdf">here</a> (page 32), and the SE 2020 class profile <a href="https://uw-se-2020-class-profile.github.io/profile.pdf">here</a> (page 46) which illustrate the same points with nice graphs.</li>
<li>[Edit (11/22/2020)] Seiji S. commented on my linkedin post and provided two studies that are more comprehensive than the class profiles I linked above:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ijwil.org/files/APJCE_16_4_225_240.pdf">this study</a> analyzes over 36,000 evaluations in 1,817 cities. The graph on page 231 shows that ~10% or less of evaluations are below "Very Good"</li>
<li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/acb0/7f80f75afedc14ae00f766e08ec7d6429e34.pdf">this other study</a> analyzes over 11,000 engineering students during the period of 2013-2017. It showed that "Over 90% of students receive ratings in the range 5â€“7" (5 being very good, 7 being outstanding)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[Edit (02/13/2021)] UWaterloo's own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210204201458/https://uwaterloo.ca/hire/recruitment-dates-and-procedure/reports-and-evaluations">website</a> states that 95% of co-op students receive Very Good or better</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to be respectful while bringing this up! Having stats that back up your position doesn't mean you should be smug or hard to talk to!</p>

<p>Let me know if this post helped you argue for a better evaluation!</p>
