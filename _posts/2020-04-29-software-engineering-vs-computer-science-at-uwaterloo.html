<p>I received this question a few weeks ago when I made a post about answering any/all questions about the University of Waterloo due to them cancelling their open house.</p>

<h2>My answer:</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm not the first person to answer this question, and there are some good answers floating online. Check&nbsp;<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/future-undergraduate-students/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://profbillanderson.com/2013/09/03/comparing-software-engineering-to-computer-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>. However, you asked for my perspective as a student and aspiring software engineer so I'll answer anyways.</p>

<p>From my own perspective, there is not much of a difference. I sometimes refer to the SE program as "CS but with extra steps". What I mean by that is that SE and CS share almost identical core CS courses. However in order for SE to be an&nbsp;<a href="https://engineerscanada.ca/accreditation/accredited-programs-by-institution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accredited engineering program</a>, SE students have to take a bunch of engineering focused courses. This can be good or bad depending on your preferences. An example of an engineering focused course that I didn't like was MATH 213 (Signals, Systems, Differential Equations). I feel like there was no point - I got a 95 in MATH 213 but yet I still can't tell you what it'll be useful for in my career or what I learned. You also have to take a bunch of courses like physics and chemistry - which again may not be useful to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Software engineers are also part of ECE, so this means that they have to take hardware and circuit courses. I also didn't like this part of the program, so that made me switch into CS where I could take purely CS courses. However, if you're the type of person who's into circuits and low level hardware stuff, SE is a better choice than CS. CS students cannot be enrolled in ECE courses by default (however, advisors can override you into a course and there's a&nbsp;<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca//current/programs/dighard/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital hardware option</a>), while SE students are considered both CS and ECE students, so they can take them as they wish.</p>

<p>Oh and an important note - I personally think it's much easier to make friends in SE than in CS. This is because SE is a cohort program. Essentially the people you meet in first year are the people you'll see every day for the next 5 years. Everybody is on the same co-op schedule, and has the same mandatory courses. Whereas in CS, you may never see your 1st year friends again since the co-op schedules differ and are more flexible. There's also more flexibility in course selection, so you're not always in the same room as the people you met in first year.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So to reiterate, here's a list of pros/cons if you were to choose SE over CS:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>pros:</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>cohort system which makes it easy to make friends and maintain friendships</li>
<li>accredited engineering program if you want to become a PEO (in the field of software it's pretty useless)</li>
<li>more selection of hardware and engineering courses</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>cons:</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>less term/co-op flexibility. If you fail a term, you have to drop a year down. If you get a co-op offer for the a wrong term, you basically can't accept it</li>
<li>less course selection freedom</li>
<li>much more mandatory non-CS courses which you may not enjoy</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>How does the quality of the co-op compare? Would you say any particular program generally gets better co-op opportunities with big tech companies (maybe faster as well)?</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In terms of co-op there's not much of a difference between CS and SE in my opinion. You may see more SE kids getting good jobs, but that's just because it's a smaller and (at the time I first got into Waterloo) more competitive program.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of the cohort system you might also hear more about it and be motivated to get better jobs? But from an employers perspective they don't have a preference for program IMO - or if there is a preference, it's tiny compared to things like work experience and side projects.</p>
