<p>I see the sentiment expressed in the title thrown around quite a bit online, specifically Reddit. Let's throw some things into a tax calculator, make some simple assumptions, and see if this is actually true!</p>

<h3>Scenario 1 (HCOL, San Francisco):</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose you're single and work in San Francisco, a notoriously HCOL area</li>
<li>Let's say you earn a total compensation of 150k, and get a 50% employer match up to 6% of your income</li>
<li>We'll assume you make the maximum 19.5k 401k contribution every year, and your employer matches 9k</li>
<li>Stick that into a <a href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#YxsUT8pEFv">tax calculator</a>, and you get ~88k/year after taxes, and 28.5k/year in your 401k</li>
<li>You can split a 2 bedroom apartment for about 1.55k per person, according to this <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-the-cost-of-living-in-san-francisco">website</a></li>
<li>Let's say you spend an additional 1.45k on food, utilities, and random stuff to get a nice round 3k expense per month</li>
<li>88k - 12*3k = 52k left in your bank account</li>
<li>After accounting for expenses, you have <strong>~52k/yr after-tax money</strong> you can save and invest, as well as <strong>28.5k/yr  in your 401k</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Scenario 2 (LCOL, Oklahoma City):</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose you're single and work in Oklahoma City. According to <a href="https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/oklahoma/oklahoma_city">this website</a>, OKC is cheaper than the US average (I'm Canadian, please don't judge me if this was for some reason a terrible choice)</li>
<li>Let's say you earn a total compensation of 70k, and get a 50% employer match up to 6% of your income</li>
<li>We'll assume you make the maximum 19.5k 401k contribution every year, and your employer matches 4.2k</li>
<li>Stick that into a <a href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/oklahoma-tax-calculator#7W2tqNEGa1">tax calculator</a>, and you get ~42k/year after taxes, and 23.7k/year in your 401k</li>
<li>Suppose you eat no food, pay no rent, have no utilities, and have no expenses, and are basically a ghost</li>
<li>With <strong>zero</strong> expenses, you have <strong>~42k/yr after-tax money</strong> you can save and invest, as well as <strong>23.7k/yr in your 401k</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, cost of living can be a significant expense! I accounted for 36k/yr expenses for living in San Francisco, and that's a pretty insane amount to just spend in my opinion. However, the cost of living argument doesn't seem to hold up when the pay differential is that huge.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Maybe it'll make a bigger difference if you're looking to settle down and raise a family. I'm a little too young to bother thinking about that though, so you can go through the exercise yourself if you want!</p>
