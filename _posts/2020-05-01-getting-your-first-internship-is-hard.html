title: Getting your first internship is HARD

<p>"How you have you found success in your interviews?"</p>

<p>I received this question in responses to a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/havinleung_uwaterloo-universityofwaterloo-internship-activity-6644332348458577920-FTfL" target="_blank">post I made</a>. Instead of answering it directly, I want to take a step back and answer a broader question which includes it.</p>

<p>The short answer is&nbsp;<strong>repeated failures</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>learning from your failures</strong>. At the time of writing this article, I've completed 5 internships and failed many, many times. Let me show you what I mean.</p>

<h2>What do you mean by repeated failures?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In my opinion, there are 2 kinds of failure related to internship/job searching. There's failing to&nbsp;<em>get the interview</em>, and then there's failing to&nbsp;<em>pass the interview</em>. I've done both of these plenty of times. I can quantify these failures with some personal statistics.</p>

<h2>Job searching statistics</h2>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>1st internship</strong>: I&nbsp;<em>applied to 50 jobs</em>&nbsp;(the maximum amount for the 1st round of my university's job board). Most of these jobs had low requirements, and some of them weren't even tech related. I only&nbsp;<em>got 1 interview</em>, and to one of the non technical jobs. Luckily, I aced it and got the job.</p>

<p><strong>2nd internship</strong>: I&nbsp;<em>applied to 50 jobs</em>, mostly tech related. About half were developer roles, half were QA and other stuff. I&nbsp;<em>got 6 interviews</em>. I failed most of the interviews and only&nbsp;<em>received 1 offer</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>3rd internship</strong>: I&nbsp;<em>applied to 40 jobs</em>, all software developer roles. I&nbsp;<em>got ~12 interviews</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>received 3-4 offers</em>.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>4th internship</strong>: Google host matching came through before I participated in the big job search.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>5th internship</strong>: I&nbsp;<em>applied to 30&nbsp;</em>software developer jobs, and only at well known companies. Think of big names like Snap, Uber, Microsoft, Facebook, etc... I had a whopping&nbsp;<em>13 interviews&nbsp;</em>(13 companies, but most of them had at least 2 rounds of interviews). I&nbsp;<em>received 6 offers</em>.</p>

<p>In the very beginning, I had abysmal conversion rates! Only 2% of my applications turned into interviews/offers. After a few internships, lots of failure, and lots of learning, my interview conversion rate is now above 40%, and my offer rate is 20%.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One thing that I couldn't quantify (easily) is that the types of jobs I applied to got more and more "prestigious" with each successive internship search. This means that if I applied to the same type of companies for each job search, the difference would be&nbsp;<em>even more pronounced</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Job searching gets&nbsp;<em>much easier</em>&nbsp;with time and experience, but the first one is&nbsp;<em>really hard to get</em></p>
